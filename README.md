This is my thesis final project about recommendation system algorithm written in python. 
The algorithm combines SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) and Copeland voting scheme. 
SVD aims to predict the ratings while Copeland will aggregate the rankings based on the predicted ratings, resulting the final list for the recommendations. 

How to run the program
1. clone the repo
2. run main.ipynb
